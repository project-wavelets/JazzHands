# Summary

Time series photometry of astronomical objects encodes information about 
these objects' physical state, and how they change on human timescales. Recent
rapid cadence observations from missions like TESS and *Kepler* have been used to
to discover exoplanets around nearby stars, measure stellar pulsations, 
characterize variability in active galactic nuclei, and more. Wavelet analysis 
is an extension of Fourier analysis that allows astronomers to examine the 
frequency content of a light curve as a function of time. As such, it is an 
ideal tool for studying real data, which often contain information that is 
otherwise impossible to extract from the Fourier transform alone. 

# Statement of need

`JazzHands` is a Python package for wavelet transformations. Typical wavelet 
methods [@torrence98] assume that the data are regularly sampled and have
no gaps. This fact has hindered astronomical applications of wavelets. Data 
taken from the ground are often irregularly sampled and have daily and seasonal
gaps due to the rotation and orbit of the Earth. While less problematic, space-
based data still have gaps due to downlink times, and time-stamp adjustments to
account for time-of-arrival differences along the spacecraft orbit induce 
sampling irregularities. Interpolative methods may be used to offset these 
effects, but introduce their own systematics into the wavelet transform.

@foster96 introduced a mathematical formulation of the wavelet transform 
using the Morlet wavelet that accounts for the effects of irregular sampling 
and gaps, and avoids the need for interpolation. `JazzHands` is the first 
open-source Python implementation of the @foster96 method, and has already
been used in scientific applications [@dornwallenstein20b]. The combination of
speed, customizability, and helpful features for users who are new to wavelet 
analysis will enable exciting new science on the wealth of high precision light
curves that are currently being released.
